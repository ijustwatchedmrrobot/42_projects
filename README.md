# libft
The first project you start to core, you make your own library with some "libc" functions, some ft functions etc.
You also write the functions in library and write a "Makefile".
You should look up for; 
-Void variables;
-Dynamic allocation;
-Structs;
-Memory, fd (file descriptor) functions;
I pushed and submitted my libft and it was working fine, though i suggest detailed research about memory functions errors etc.
P.S: I didn't make the bonuses because of the deadline but you will be using "lists" a lot in next projects, i may add later.
